    When the Jenkins <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JIRA+Plugin">JIRA plugin</a> is enabled,
    synchronize information about JIRA issues to Artifactory and attach issue information to build artifacts. This
    allows you to quickly identify build artifacts that contain a fix for a specific issue.
