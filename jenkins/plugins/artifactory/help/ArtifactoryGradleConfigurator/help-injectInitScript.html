<div>
    The Jenkins plugin automatically applies the Artifactory plugin (and, consequently, the 'artifactoryPublish' task)
    to all projects.<br/> Check this flag to have Jenkins skip this step if your project is already using the Artifactory
    plugin or the 'artifactoryPublish' task directly. All elements in this job configuration will override matching
    project-level configuration elements.
